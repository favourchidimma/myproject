    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Some nights entertain. Others transform the culture. These five events
      weren’t just parties—they redefined nightlife and left lasting legacies.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">1. Neon Pulse Night</h3>
    <p>
      A fusion of EDM and Afrobeat brought over 2,000 guests together under a
      canopy of lasers and fog. The dancefloor vibrated with energy as every beat
      became a collective pulse.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">2. Comedy Carnival</h3>
    <p>
      Five of Nigeria’s top comedians lit up the stage, but Basketmouth’s
      surprise appearance stole the show. The entire venue roared with laughter
      late into the night.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">3. Cinema Under the Stars</h3>
    <p>
      Rooftop views, gourmet popcorn, beanbags, and a skyline backdrop. The
      screening of <em>Black Panther</em> wasn’t just a film—it was a shared
      dream under the stars.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">4. DJ Battle Royale</h3>
    <p>
      Two DJs went head-to-head. One stage, one crowd, and bass drops that shook
      the floor. The audience crowned the victor in a battle of sound and skill.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">5. Masquerade Ball</h3>
    <p>
      Elaborate masks, hypnotic rhythms, and opulent décor created a world where
      fantasy and nightlife blended seamlessly. Guests danced until dawn in
      timeless style.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The DJ booth is more than a stage—it’s the heartbeat of every event.
      Behind the lights and music lies a story of creativity, discipline, and
      passion.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">The Creative Process</h3>
    <p>
      Hours of playlist curation go into a single night. DJs read the crowd,
      adjust tempo, and craft emotional journeys through carefully chosen beats.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Tech Meets Talent</h3>
    <p>
      From vinyl to digital decks, modern DJs merge old-school artistry with
      cutting-edge technology. Every drop is intentional, every transition a
      crafted story.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Pre-Show Rituals</h3>
    <p>
      Meditation, sound checks, last-minute tweaks—the preparation is as vital as
      the performance itself. By the time the first track hits, the vibe is set.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-4 my-6 italic text-gray-300">
      'I dont just play music. I tell stories through sound'. – DJ Krossfade
    </blockquote>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Backstage Energy</h3>
    <p>
      Sweat, adrenaline, and unfiltered emotion define the booth. It’s where
      nerves and excitement collide, producing the raw energy that fuels the
      crowd.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Experience It Live</h2>
    <p>
      Arrive early, stay close to the booth, and feel the music in its purest
